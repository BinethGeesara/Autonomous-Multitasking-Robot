# Autonomous Multitasking Robot Team Voyegers
Our very first robot build — developed as a team project as part of the Embedded Systems coursework. Designed to perform line following, wall following, and pick & place tasks using a custom-built robotic arm.
🔧 Key Features & Technologies:

🧠 Controller:
• ESP32 microcontroller
• CD4051 multiplexer for GPIO optimization

👁️ Sensors & Detection:
• QTR-8A IR sensor array for line following
• 2 additional IR sensors for junction detection (total: 10 IR sensors)
• Front IR sensor with interrupt-based box detection
• Wall following using front IR + side-mounted TOF sensor

🚗 Drive System:
• 2× N20 6V 300 RPM motors
• Powered at 12V using a TB6612 motor driver
🦾 Robotic Arm:
• Custom-designed 2-DOF arm
• 3D printed structure with 2× SG90 servo motors

🔋 Power & Build:
• 11.1V 1500mAh LiPo battery
• Multiple buck converters for voltage regulation
• Acrylic base + double-sided dot board for component assembly
